* Move Data.Object functions from `Emulator` types to pure `EmuState` readers
* Once above is done, migrate `object`, etc. to a `Lens' EmuState Object` form:
  * object :: Word -> Lens' EmuState Object
  * setAttr, getAttr, clearAttr, etc. follow
* Setter for properties is more difficult - attempting to append the
  properties list should cause an error, but changing an existing property
  should work as expected.
